Offline Anomaly Detection in Energy & Efficiency Using Machine Learning (Python-Based)

I am developing an offline application titled “Anomaly Detection in Energy & Efficiency Using Machine Learning”, built using the Python programming language. The system is designed to run entirely on a local machine without requiring an internet connection.

Updated Requirements & Functional Specifications
1. Login Page (Standalone)
The system should begin with a plain, standalone login page, separate from the main dashboard.

This page should include:

Login form for existing users (username and password).

Signup option for new users to register.

Authentication should be handled locally, using an offline database (e.g., SQLite).

2. Dashboard Interface
Once the user successfully logs in, they should be redirected to a professional dashboard.

The dashboard must include:

A side navigation panel for easy access to all sections.

A modern and clean user interface with professional themes (e.g., sleek color palettes, modern fonts, subtle animations).

Support for responsive design if needed on different screen sizes.

3. Dashboard Features (Tabs/Sections)
The dashboard should contain the following key tabs or sections:

Generate Sample Data:

Allow the user to automatically generate synthetic/sample energy consumption data for testing anomaly detection algorithms.

Add Custom Data:

Enable users to upload or manually enter their own energy usage data for analysis.

View Anomalies:

Display detected anomalies in energy usage through visualizations (e.g., graphs, tables, heatmaps).

Model Evaluation:

Show performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc., for the models being used.

Recommendations:

Provide suggestions for improving energy efficiency based on the anomalies identified.

Technology Stack:
Backend: Python

Framework: Flask (for routing and interface control)

Database: SQLite (for local storage of users and data)

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for AutoEncoders), Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn

Frontend Styling: HTML, CSS (professional templates/themes), optionally Tailwind or Bootstrap for sleek UI
